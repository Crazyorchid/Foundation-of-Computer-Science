Problem 1- In insertion.java, the override method was not implemented, and the overridden method was changed to be able to override and sort strings by converting strings to characters and compared to size of each of them.
Problem 1- Changes were made to the public int [] sortStringByIndex(String [] arr), and the method was changed with compareTo to compare the Strings.

Problem 2- The method searchStaffByAge used BinarySearching according the the objective searching created earlier. Binary searching requires the array to be sorted first and then it can be searched. In Company.java, the method SortStaffByAge(); is called in SearchStaffByAge(); first, and then the binary searching can be conducted.

Problem-3 The selection should be written and then the methods in Company.java were changed from insertion to selection.
